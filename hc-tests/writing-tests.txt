== Overview ==

The test writing infrastructure is designed to make it really simple for anyone to write a new test.

All tests are implemented in classes which extend the HealthCheckTest base class and must implement the run_test function.
The base class has utility functions to assert different results and store an message and severity on failure of the assertion.

== Examples ==

The php-configuration tests show the framework in its simplest usage.
The dummy tests should not be used as a basis for developing tests as they access the results object directly and this is discouraged.
